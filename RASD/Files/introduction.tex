\subsection{Purpose}

Safestreet is the name of an application aiming to offer principally 
the possibility to signal traffic or parking violation via the internet 
to public authorities.
This document aims to outline the functioning of said app, providing a 
deep insight of the software and supporting the stakeholders.

Safestreet offers, as a basic functionality, the possibility to fill in 
a form detailing one of the possible violations (e.g. illegal parking) 
to every single user. The application gives its users the possibility 
to compile a form complete with a brief description of the wrongdoing 
and several additional information. Said information consists of the 
position of the user at the time of the report (street name) and some 
pictures, to be attached to the form itself in some way (for example 
using the smartphone on which the app is installed). The form can then 
be either approved and investigated or discarded by the public authorities 
working at the interested area (in both cases the user is warned of the end 
result of their report). At the same moment Safestreet stores data received 
by those warnings and computes them to highlight areas in which a violation 
is most likely to occur, or to show which type of vehicle tends to be 
associated with different wrongdoings.

In addition to what is written above, the data mined from the warnings 
can be crossed with that offered by the municipality. If a specific part 
of the city presents an alarming number of reports it may mean that the 
infrastructures provided to the population are inadequate or that part 
of the citizens (especially the weaker ones such as bikers or the elderly) 
is not preserved enough, thus some suggestions can be made to the authorities 
in order to avoid further inconveniences.

\subsection{Goals}

The goals set are expressed from the point of view of the S2B:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [G1]{The application has to store all the information about violations sent to it, until a ticket is either dropped or accepted by an authority}
    \item [G2]{The system must accepts reports issued from every part of the covered area }
    \item [G3]{The system must allow authorities to access reports in every part of the covered area}
    \item [G4]{The application allows users and authorities to mine information on the system}
    \item [G5]{The application identifies unsafe areas crossing its informations with those offered by the municipality}
    \item [G6]{The application suggests possible solution to problems perceived after the crossing of information}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope}

Safestreet poses itself as an intermediate between users and authorities.\\
Users file reports via the mobile app. 
Authorities (e.g. a police person) examine the report and can discard it or 
investigate it, leading to a positive result (fine or warning) or negative 
one (no violation revealed).\\
Saved reports are analyzed and data extracted by them can be consulted 
both by users and authorities (at different levels).
If the municipality offers data about accidents, they are crossed with 
those obtained by SafeStreets and suggestion based on them are made. 
Data is visible to everyone (at different levels).

\subsection{Document Structure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Overall description}: a general description of the 
    service is provided, together with a furter inspection on shared 
    phenomena. Relevant functions of the System are explained. 
    Finally, through the specifications of constraints, dependencies 
    and assumptions, it is unveiled how the System is integrated 
    in the real world.
    \item \textbf{Specific requirements}: aimed to both designers 
    and testers, all the aspects of the previous section are put 
    into perspective. Requirements are fully explained and divided 
    by types and possible interactions with the System are investigated 
    through use cases and sequence diagrams.
