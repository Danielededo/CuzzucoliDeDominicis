\subsection{External Interface Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Images/Templates/User/us_2.png}
\caption{\label{fig:Mockup-1}Login}
\end{figure}

This is the first page the users are shown. To continue they have to input their cellphone number and to insert an OTP sent to them by the system.

\begin{figure} [H]

\caption{\label{fig:Mockup-2}Menu and File Report section}
In this case it is shown how the report of violations is handled. The users enters the correct area and fills all the fields. If the plate is recognized, the report can be sent. This does not happen in the opposite case.
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Images/Templates/User/us_4.PNG}
\caption{\label{fig:Mockup-3}List Violations and List Accidents sections}
Upon entering on the apposite areas, the users are shown a list of streets with information about violations. If a precise one is selected, the types are linked to their quantities.
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Authority Interfaces}
\begin{figure} [H]
\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{Images/Templates/Authority/auth_0.PNG}
\caption{\label{fig:Mockup-4}Menu and List Accidents section}
\end{figure}

Authorities can select unsafe streets from the section regarding accidents. If said street is listed as \textit{unsafe}, the type of most common violations is shown. A suggestion is made accordingly, as it can be argued that if drivers tend to reiterate a specific mistake, it is possible that this is the cause of the accidents.


\begin{figure} [H]
\includegraphics[scale=0.49]{Images/Templates/Authority/auth_1.PNG}
\caption{\label{fig:Mockup-5}Check Report section}
\end{figure}

Authorities can discard specific violations or take them in charge. If the latter happens, they are guided to the site of the violation exploiting GM' API.

\begin{figure} [H]
\includegraphics[scale=0.48]{Images/Templates/Authority/auth_2.PNG}
\caption{\label{fig:Mockup-6}List Violations section}
\end{figure}

Authorities can see the list of the offenders, street by street, for any kind of violation.

\begin{figure} [H]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Images/Templates/Authority/auth_3.PNG}
\caption{\label{fig:Mockup-7}Web Login interface}
\end{figure}

Safestreets is provided with a web interface for those authorities who are assigned to administrative section.

\begin{figure} [H]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5255]{Images/Templates/Authority/auth_4.PNG}
\caption{\label{fig:Mockup-8}Web interface}
\end{figure}

This version is used merely for data analysis and inspection.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}

The application is available to those who have a smartphone with internet connection (to communicate with SafeStreet), a camera (to take photos of the violations) and a GPS tracker (to provide the position).
The web application for authorities can be accessed by any computer with a web browser.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}

\begin{itemize}

\item Browser
\item Web Server Application
\item Operating System: iOS, Android
\item DBMS

\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}

This application requires an Internet connection for the purpose of transmitting the report information, HTTPS protocol is used to transfer the data securely between the user and the DBMS.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
The system must be able to handle large quantities of data. On the other hand the importance of speed is limited as violations and their report does not have to be handled at the same moment they are put into the system.

\subsection{Design Constraints}

\subsubsection{Hardware Limitation}

The application does not have strict hardware limitation. Nevertheless it requires:

\begin{itemize}

\item 2G/3G/4G connection

\item Working camera

\item GPS

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software System Attributes}

\subsubsection{Reliability}

The system should guarantee 99\% of reliability: its component must have a failure rate that guarantees this goal.

\subsubsection{Availability}

The service should ideally be available 24/7.

\subsubsection{Security}

The system uses HTTPS protocol for communication. Plate numbers are stored and encrypted.
