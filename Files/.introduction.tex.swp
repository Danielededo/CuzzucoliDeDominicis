\subsection{Purpose}

Safestreet is the name of an application aiming to offer principally the possibility to signal traffic or parking violation via the internet to public authorities.
This document aims to outline the functioning of said app, providing a deep insight of the software and supporting the stakeholders.

Safestreet offers, as a basic functionality, the possibility to fill in a form detailing one of the possible violations (e.g. illegal parking) to every single user. The application gives its users the possibility to compile a form complete with a brief description of the wrongdoing and several additional information. Said information consists of the position of the user at the time of the report (street name) and some pictures, to be attached to the form itself in some way (for example using the smartphone on which the app is installed). The form can then be either approved and investigated or discarded by the public authorities working at the interested area (in both cases the user is warned of the end result of their report). At the same moment Safestreet stores data received by those warnings and computes them to highlight areas in which a violation is most likely to occur, or to show which type of vehicle tends to be associated with different wrongdoings.

In addition to what is written above, the data mined from the warnings can be crossed with that offered by the municipality. If a specific part of the city presents an alarming number of reports it may mean that the infrastructures provided to the population are inadequate or that part of the citizens (especially the weaker ones such as bikers or the elderly) is not preserved enough, thus some suggestions can be made to the authorities in order to avoid further inconveniences.

\subsection{Goals}

The goals set are expressed from the point of view of the S2B:

\begin{itemize}


\item [G1]{The application has to store all the information about violations sent to it, until a ticket is either dropped or accepted by an authority}

\item [G2]{The system must accepts reports issued from every part of the covered area }

\item [G3]{The system must allow authorities to access reports in every part of the covered area}

\item [G4]{The application allows users and authorities to mine information on the system}

\item [G5]{The application identifies unsafe areas crossing its informations with those offered by the municipality}

\item [G6]{The application suggests possible solution to problems perceived after the crossing of information}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope}

Safestreet poses itself as an intermediate between users, willing to report violations to be cleared, and those that monitor the overall situation and administer fines or any other kind of punishment.

%The application should keep every procedure as simple as possible in order to maximize the number of users actively using as it is meant not only for digital natives but also for elderly people who have little to no experience with electronic devices and softwares. 

The users willing to exploit the software must insert pictures and the position of the infraction, while additional information can be expressed as a brief description of the problem. Nowithstanding that the system runs  an algorithm to identify the license plate of the vehicle in the photos, the user can add the number which the license plate bears, to improve the accuracy of the report, in case there were any trouble with the recognition (e.g. wrong plate or partial identification) the report is not accepted nor signalled and the user must file a new one.

Once a report is sent to the system, it is available to any authority who has gained access in a previous moment. Whoever reads such report can examine it and decide whether it needs to be checked or not. If, examining the picture(s), the authority in charge at the time (for example a policeperson) deems that every rule has been respected, then they choose that the report be discarded and its data is cancelled, elseway they can communicate that they are willing to inspect. Once the inspection is concluded the result can be either positive (the violation is verified and a fine or a warning is issued) or negative (there is none breaking the law at the moment), in the former option, the authority closes the case and its data is stored, in the latter one, the case is discarded and the data is erased to avoid padding.

Please, note that while authorities are entitled to see every report sent from various users in their city, citizens can just see their own reports and save them on their memory.
